So much so that many of my colleagues work largely in JupyterHub or Sagemaker. Notebooks provide a convenient enviroment for quick prototyping, and they feel natural for data scientists that (like me) don&amp;rsquo;t have a formal computer science background. That said, I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that we are using them in many cases where they aren&amp;rsquo;t worth the downsides, and even that the popular wisdom that they are a good place to get started quickly has it quite backwards.</description></item></channel></rss>
